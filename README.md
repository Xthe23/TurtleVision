# TurtleVision

## Overview

TurtleVision is a dedicated project for ComputerCraft's turtle. This repository contains modules that interact with the Turtle API, offering functionalities like pattern generation, movement, harvesting, fuel management, and more.

## Modules
- [**Pattern Generation**](https://github.com/Xthe23/TurtleVision/blob/main/src/modules/patternGeneration.lua): Generates specific patterns based on grid dimensions.
- [**Movement**](https://github.com/Xthe23/TurtleVision/blob/main/src/modules/turtleMovement.lua): Handles the turtle's movement across the grid.
- [**Harvesting**](https://github.com/Xthe23/TurtleVision/blob/main/src/modules/harvestDetection.lua): Manages the harvesting operations performed by the turtle.
- [**Fuel Management**](https://github.com/Xthe23/TurtleVision/blob/main/src/modules/fuelManager.lua): Ensures the turtle has sufficient fuel for its operations.

# Future Enhancements

 - Implement a GUI for easier interaction.
 - Add more advanced harvesting techniques.
 - Optimize fuel consumption.
 -  Integrate 'startup.lua' to ensure seamless recovery and continuation of turtle tasks after restarts or disruptions.
